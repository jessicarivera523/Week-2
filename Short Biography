    <h2>Jessica Rivera</h1>
    <p>My favorite childhood memory was going camping with my family. We would enjoy driving up the Rocky Mountains and finding the perfect spot. When that spot was found, usually by a meadow, we would happily set up camp. The best thing was when nightcame came around. Smores where cooked on an open fire and the grownups would tell scary stories.</p>
<p>Another great memory from camping was waking up the next day in the wilderness. Hearing the birds and smelling the fresh air was amazing. Of course on the second day, the reak adventures began. </p>

<h2>Job History</h1>
<p>In highschool I worked many service industry jobs all of which where in the now very changed foothills mall. I then became a bank teller in 2010 and learned many financial skills. In 2014 I was hired at CSU to work in the Medical Health Center. I am currently unemployed focusing on going to school and caring for my 3 year special needs twins.</p>

<h2>Favorite Color</h1>

<p>My favorite color is Red. Although I dont like to personally wear the color often, I enjoy decorating my home with it.</p>
