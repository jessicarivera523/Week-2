    <p>My favorite childhood memory was going camping with my family. We would enjoy driving up the Rocky Mountains and finding the perfect spot. When that spot was found, usually by a meadow, we would happily set up camp. The best thing was when nightcame came around. Smores where cooked on an open fire and the grownups would tell scary stories.</p>

<p>Another great memory from camping was waking up the next day in the wilderness. Hearing the birds and smelling the fresh air was amazing. Of course on the second day, the reak adventures began. </p>
